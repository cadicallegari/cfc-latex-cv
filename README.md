Claudinei Francisco Callegari
======================

I'm a Brazilian computer cientist since 2011. In the past few years
working as a software engineer in different companies on numerous
projects envolving languages such as C/C++, Python, Java and Ruby and
Linux, OSX and Windows platform.

Passionate software developer, good team-player, can-do attitude,
always trying to think out of the box. I would like to work in a
challenging technical and agile development environment.

I'm interested in a full-stack web developer position, rather the 
Ruby on Rails or Python/Django web framework. I hold a high 
standard of quality in everything that I do, and
believe agile methodologies and test-driven development lead 
to better applications.
